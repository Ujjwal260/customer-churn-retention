# Customer Churn & Retention Strategy (Telecom)

## 📌 Business Problem
Customer churn represents a significant revenue risk for telecom businesses, as acquiring new customers is substantially more expensive than retaining existing ones.

This project identifies customers most likely to churn, explains the key drivers behind churn behaviour, and proposes cost-effective, data-driven retention strategies that can be operationalised by the business.

The project demonstrates how predictive analytics can be translated into clear business decisions using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
